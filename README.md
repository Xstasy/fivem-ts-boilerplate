This is a basic boilerplate for creating a FiveM resource using Typescript. It includes a webpack config file and a directory structure to get you started. We recommend to use [fivem-js](https://github.com/d0p3t/fivem-js) alongside this boilerplate for faster development of client scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone repository to wherever you want.
2. `npm i` or `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. Change lines at top of webpack.config.js to reflect your desired settings.
4. Start development.

### Development
Use `npm run watch` or `yarn watch` to watch files during development.

### Production
Build your production ready code with `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

This will build the client and server script with the `--mode production` flag.
